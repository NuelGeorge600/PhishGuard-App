Help users identify if a URL might be fake, suspicious, or a phishing attempt by analyzing key red flags in the URL structure.
🚀 What It Will Do:
1. Accept a URL as input
2. Analyze the URL for common red flags:
Is it using an IP address instead of a domain?
Does it contain "@" or other unusual characters?
Is it trying to mimic popular websites? (e.g. gooogle.com)
3. Display a warning message if suspicious
